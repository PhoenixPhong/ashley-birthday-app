
<div>
	I wanted to paint your portrait, but my hands can't do your beauty justice... 
</div>

<div>
	I wanted to write you another love song, but you remember how the last one went...
</div>

<div>
	I wanted to take you around the world, but for now we'll have to continue to daydream...
</div>

<div>
	I wish I could do something like this for you, all of these, all at once...
</div>

<div>
	But for this birthday of yours, I'll share the greatest gift I have ever received on this earth...
</div>

<div>
	My beautiful view of you...
</div>










<div>
	A letter to my best friend...
</div>


<div>
	,
	Please give me a moment to explain what this is all about. I know it may seem a bit  
	odd at first, pulling up a website with so many of your memories on display,
	but if you'll read on a little more, and bear with my complicated mind in the way that only YOU
	know how to, I think you'll understand...
</div>

<div>
	You've reached an incredible milestone in your life, and I'm not only talking about your 
	birthday. 
</div>

<div>
	When I was trying to figure out what my gift to you for your birthday was going to be, my mind was 
	flooded with ideas, some attainable, some not so much...for now.
</div>

<div>
	You ask for nothing, but of course me being me, I want to give you everything you've never asked for.
</div>

<div>
	I wish I could build you a palace, even though all you've ever wanted was a yardful of dogs, and a 
	cottage built for 2...
</div>

<div>
	I wish I could fly you anywhere in the world on command, rather than only in our daydreams...
</div>

<div>
	I wish I could write you a song, (or rather a better song than the last one), so that all the lovers to come would sing your
	name forever...
</div>

<div>
	I wish I had the gift of poetry...
</div>

<div>
	I wish I could give all of these to you, all at once. But for today, I can't. So for now, allow me to share with you the 
	greatest gift I have ever known...this life witnessing you...I've had the best seat in the house for the last 22 years...
	Albeit, only a brief glimpse into the most amazing view I'll ever know. You.
